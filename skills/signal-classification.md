# signal-classification.md

Triage every raw signal before output. Three questions:

## 1. Relevant?
Discard if none apply:
- Mentions any of the 50 monitored competitors by name or brand
- Relates to nonprofit investment advisory, endowments, OCIO, or RFP activity
- Involves personnel, content, clients, or filings from any monitored firm

If uncertain → flag `RELEVANCE: Uncertain`, pass through with note.

## 2. Signal type?
`RFP` · `Client` · `Content` · `LinkedIn` · `ADV` · `Behavioral` · `Campaign`

If spans multiple → classify by primary action, note secondary.
Campaign vs. Content: a single published piece is `Content`. Two or more surfaces
running a shared nonprofit theme within 60 days is `Campaign`.

## 3. Priority?

**High** — any of:
- Named client win announced
- New gated asset published (always flag for behavioral-pattern-analysis)
- Content coaching nonprofits to skip/reframe RFP process
- New RFP response or public RFP issued to any monitored firm found
- New hire or departure at director level+
- ADV shows 20%+ change in charitable org client count
- Coordinated campaign detected: 2+ surfaces, shared nonprofit theme, within 60 days (always flag for behavioral-pattern-analysis)

**Medium** — any of (Tier 1 only):
- New article, guide, webinar, market commentary
- LinkedIn post with 50+ reactions or 10+ comments
- Minor ADV change

**Low** — relevant but doesn't meet above thresholds

**Discard** — not relevant
